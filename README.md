agshoes is an archives management tool

It provides the entire system to install, configure, enable; and record one's digital life

I personally use the aggressive alias of `_` for `agshoes`, but I would, wouldn't I.

## Opinions

I'm not synchronizing everything for everyone for all time.

Ground rules:
- Standard formats are always best. Examples:
    - [CommonMark](NK) (Markdown) - Excellent for lightly marked up documents
    - HTML - Ideally self contained, either as raw HTML or as a JavaScript app which accesses local data.
    - [Maildir](NK) - The worst option, except for all the others.
    - JPEG, PNG, SVG - Original source files are fine, but it's always nice to have a permanent authoritative copy.
- I live in an apple ecosystem, and so long as there's a prayer of getting it to a standard format later, saving is better than nothing.
- New things are fine, but not every new thing has to claim permanent territory in my permanent archives. New is for experience, staid is for memory.

## Current objectives:

File sources allow us to manage many of the following in Dropbox or one of its many competitors.
