Ultimately, everything about agshoes exists to create the final archive. There are different components to that archive that factor into its layout.

- Working directories: these have works-in-progress
- Write-only-archives: including `Photos`, `Records`
- Database syncs: where the data lives elsewhere, like `IMAP`, `CalDAV`, &c



- `Documents`: these are works-in-progress. Typically they are of types:
- `Documents/projects`: associated files which will no longer be needed once the project is over
- `Documents/quickref`: aka cheat sheets which will never be "complete", but updated with useful notes and referenced when needed
- `Documents/runbooks`: contain standard processes to be referenced whenever they need to be done. Not updated often.
- `Documents/works`: things that probably should be blog posts, but suck too badly.

- `Pictures`: pictures, sorted by date. Authored by myself.
- `Records`: documents which are fully complete, organized by date. Eg `Records/2016/07/17/birth-certificate.jpg`

- `shared/Family`: shared with Sage
- `shared/actant`: share with Sean
- `shared/chef-brigade`: shared with brigade members

- `src`: source code of all stripes. This should really not be included.
* `src/gitlab.com/josephholsten/dotfiles`: personal configuration for use on any workstation
* `src/github.com/josephholsten/bin`: scripts, not including ones fully packaged and kept elsewhere in `src`
